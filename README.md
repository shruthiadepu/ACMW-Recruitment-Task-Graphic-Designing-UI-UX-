# ACMW-Recruitment-Task-Graphic-Designing-UI-UX-
# About
This repository is for the ACMW BITS Pilani Chapter's recruitment process. I've applied for positions in the graphic design and UI/UX verticals.

## Graphic Designing
Task- Using Photoshop, create an Instagram post for the launch of a tech series offering courses in AI, ML, app development, and web development.
I had no prior experience in GD. I learned a great deal while performing the task.
Approach to the project:
Since it's an Instagram post (tried to follow ACMW's Instagram post pattern), I wanted to keep it clean and appealing. Tone, color, and hue adjustments, layer styles and effects, selection and masking tools, and other tools were used. Minimized text and highlighted courses to give readers a sense of the post before reading it.

## UI/UX
Task- Using FIGMA, create a UI clone of the Aarogya Setu main page. I had no prior GD experience. I gained considerable insight while working on the task. After using Photoshop, I became familiar with the tools, which made things a little simpler.
Approach to the project:
I divided the home page into subparts, grouped them, and worked on them one at a time. Icons from Iconify were used, which saved me a lot of time. I used a drop shadow effect on a couple rectangles to create a 'button' impression.
